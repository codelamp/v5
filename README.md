## Node/Babel/Browserify/Metalsmith Scaffold

### Overview

Just a simple starter, to help get up and running with the items I'd generally be using in smaller projects.

- Node for the build, and subsequent serving perhaps using Express.
- Bable for modern js syntax
- Browserify to convert the js to be browser-ready
- Metalsmith to generate the HTML content either from Markdown or JSON sources
